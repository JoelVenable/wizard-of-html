        <p>The Good Witch of the South is Glinda the Good. She is the most powerful of the Witches. According

          Wizard of Oz, chapter 18, "Away to the South"</blockquote>
        <p>So she was the most beautiful of the four witches. Later books in Baum's Oz series refer to Glinda
          as a Sorceress, rather than a Witch.</p>
